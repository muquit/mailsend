	connection is encrypted from start to end. Note: No checking is 
	performed on certificate. At this time, smtp.gmail.com does SMTP over 
	SSL on port 465.

    - When using -info and -smtp, message was wrong.
    - Greetings can be multi line. Thanks to Keith B Smith.

    first attachment.

    flag +D. Thanks to Mr S J Hannan for the bug report.
    (May-20-2006)

    not verify if the file is binary or text.

    - new flags +b, +c

    - when stdin is greater than BUFSIZ such that a "." is encountered in 
    the middle of a line at just the right point there was a bug that
