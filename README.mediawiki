'''mailsend''' is a simple command line program to send mail via [[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0821.txt?number=821|SMTP]] protocol. I needed to send a piece of alert mail from a program in a networked Windows machine, but could not find a simple program like this installed. So I wrote one. You might find it useful in some situations. The program does not use any config file and I plan to keep it that way.  

'''From version 1.17b1+, IPv6 is supported in all platforms.'''

Suggestions, bug reports are always welcome.

== How to compile/install ==
=== Linux/Unix/Mac OS X ===
    $ /bin/sh ./configure --with-openssl=/usr

In Mac OS X Mavericks as of Oct-27-2013, you have to do the following:

    $ /bin/sh ./configure --with-openssl=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/usr

Default installation location is /usr/local. If you want to change that:

    $ /bin/ch ./configure --with-openssl=/usr --prefix=/usr/local/mailsend
    $ make clean
    $ make
    # make install
    Or
    $ sudo make install
    Or
    $ make install DESTDIR=/foo


The name of the binary will be mailsend. If compiled with OpenSSL, the support for STARTTLS and SMTP over SSL will be available.
=== Linux Debian package ===
A Debian package is also supplied. To install the package, type: 

    $ sudo dpkg -i mailsend_1.17b14-ubuntu_i386.deb

To uninstall, type:

    $ sudo dpkg -r mailsend 

If you prefer to build the Debian package yourself, after compiling, type: 

    $ ruby ./mk_debian_package.rb 

=== Microsoft Windows ===
A compiled binary for MS Windows is already supplied. However, if you need to modify something or want to compile it yourself, you will need MS Visual Studio (I used MS Visual Studio 10, freely available from Microsoft).  You have to find and run the vsvars32.bat file that came with Visual Studio first in order to use VS from command line. To compile, open a command shell and type:

    c:\> nmake -f Makefile.nmake clean
    c:\> nmake -f Makefile.nmake

It compiles cleanly with cygwin as well. The name of the binary will be mailsend.exe 

== Known Issues ==
* For text or html attachments, \r\n is not added at the end of lines. Some SMTP servers (e.g. qmail) does not like that. It will be fixed in some future release.
* For non ascii characters, MIME headers are not converted as per RFC2047
* In Windows, non ascii characters can not be entered with -M from command line (Works fine in Linux and Mac). '''mailsend''' uses standard C string functions and Windows versions do not know about multibyte input from  command line ([[https://github.com/muquit/mailsend/issues/14|Issue #14]]). If anyone is familiar with it, you are welcome to implement the support, unfortunately I do not have time at this time.
