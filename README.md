# Announcement (Feb-11-2019)

If you use mailsend, please try [mailsend-go](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend-go). Your feedback will be appreciated.

mailsend will still be maintained (critical security fixes) but no new features will be added.

Thanks!

# mailsend v1.19

**mailsend** is a simple command line program to send mail via [SMTP](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0821.txt?number=821) protocol. Long time ago, I needed to send a piece of alert mail from a program in a networked Windows machine, but could not find a simple program like this installed. So I wrote one. You might find it useful as well. The program does not use any config file and I plan to keep it that way. **From version 1.17b1+, IPv6 is supported in all platforms.** Suggestions, bug reports are always welcome. If you have any question, request or suggestion, please enter it in the [Issues](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend/issues/) with appropriate label.

The options with asterisk must be specified. Environment variable **SMTP_USER_PASS** can be used to set the  SMTP authentication password instead of the option +-pass+

## How to compile/install

### Linux/Unix/Mac OS X

Specify the path of OpenSSL with +--with-openssl+. In most Linux systems, it is installed in +/usr+. If OpenSSL is installed in non-standard places, type +./configure --help+ for options.

```
   $ /bin/sh ./configure --with-openssl=/usr
```

Default installation location is +/usr/local+. If you want to change that:

```
   $ /bin/sh ./configure --with-openssl=/usr --prefix=/usr/local/mailsend
   $ make clean
   $ make
   # make install
   Or
   $ sudo make install
   Or
   $ make install DESTDIR=/foo
```

The name of the binary will be mailsend. If compiled with OpenSSL, the
support for STARTTLS and SMTP over SSL will be available.

### Linux Debian package

Starting from mailsend v1.18, Debian package is no longer supplied. If you want to build the Debian package yourself, after compiling mailsend, type:

```
   $ ruby scripts/mk_debian_package.rb
```

To install the package, type:

```java
   $ sudo dpkg -i mailsend_1.19-ubuntu_i386.deb
```

To uninstall, type:

```java
   $ sudo dpkg -r mailsend
```

### Microsoft Windows

A compiled binary with SMTP authentication support for MS Windows is already supplied. However, if you need to modify something or want to compile it yourself, you will need freely available Visual Studio from Microsoft. For Visual Studio 2015 community edition, start **Developer Command Prompt for VS2015**.

OpenSSL is required, if you need to compile with SMTP authentication support. Look at +INSTALL.32+ that comes with OpenSSL on how to compile and install OpenSSL. mailsendâ€™s +Makefile.nmake+ expects it to be installed at +c:\openssl+

To compile mailsend, open a command shell and type:

```
   c:\> nmake -f Makefile.nmake clean
   c:\> nmake -f Makefile.nmake
```

It compiles cleanly with cygwin as well. The name of the binary will be +mailsend.exe+

## Known Issues

* For text or html attachments, \r\n is not added at the end of lines. Some SMTP servers (e.g. qmail) does not like that. It will be fixed in some future release.
* For non ascii characters, MIME headers are not converted as per RFC2047
* In Windows, non ascii characters can not be entered in subject or with +-M+ from
command line (Works fine in Linux and Mac). **mailsend** uses standard C
string functions and Windows versions do not know about multibyte input
from command line ([Issue# 14](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend/issues/14)). If anyone is familiar with it, you are welcome to implement the support, unfortunately I do not have time at this time.
